I am Annappa B, a passionate educator, researcher, and innovator in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. With a diverse academic journey and over 25 years of experience in teaching and research, I have had the privilege to contribute to various areas of computer science, especially in cloud computing, big data analytics, distributed computing, software engineering, and process mining.

I began my academic pursuits at the Govt. U.B.D.T. College of Engineering, Davangere, where I earned my B.E. degree. Later, my thirst for knowledge and research led me to the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, where I achieved my M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and engineering.

Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in academia, serving as a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the same esteemed institute where I pursued my higher education. I take great pride in being associated with the [**National Institute of Technology Karnataka**]("https://www.nitk.ac.in/"), Surathkal, India.

Research has been a driving force in my career, and I am delighted to have authored more than 100 research papers published in international conferences and journals. Over the years, I have actively participated in organizing and chairing various international conferences and have served as a reviewer for several esteemed journals.

I am deeply committed to nurturing innovation and development in the academic community. Presently, I serve as the President of the Institute Innovation Council and the Chairman of the Career Development Cell. These roles allow me to inspire and guide young minds to explore their potential and contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science.


I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers, students, and enthusiasts as we collectively advance the frontiers of technology and innovation.
